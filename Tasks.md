Nice — solid repo layout. I split the frontend work into four developer “buckets” so each person can own a vertical slice (features + services + tests) while minimizing merge conflicts. I also included ready-to-copy task cards, acceptance criteria, and dev-process rules (branch names, PR checklist, API contracts to coordinate with backend). No timing estimates — just clear priorities and what each dev must deliver.

# High-level split (4 people)

Each person owns their feature area **end-to-end**: UI, routes, services, models, unit tests, mock data, and API contract notes.

## Dev A — **Core & Auth & Profile**

Ownership

* `src/app/core/` (interceptors, guards, auth.service)
* `src/app/features/auth/` (login, register, forgot password)
* `src/app/features/profile/` (profile view, edit, order history)
* Global app shell: `header`, `footer`, `toast` wiring
* App-level state for current user (simple RxJS BehaviorSubject or NGRX slice if using store)
  Tasks (suggested tickets)

1. Project bootstrap & authentication flow

   * Implement `auth.service.ts` methods: `login`, `logout`, `register`, `refreshToken`, `getCurrentUser`.
   * `auth.interceptor.ts` to attach bearer tokens and handle 401 -> redirect to login.
   * `auth.guard.ts` to protect routes.
   * Mock backend responses in `assets/mock/` for dev.
   * Forms: reactive forms + validators.
2. Profile & orders

   * `profile` module: view/edit fields, upload avatar, change password.
   * `profile` should call `/api/users/me`, `/api/users/me/orders`.
3. App shell + header auth states

   * Header: show login/register or user dropdown with logout, profile link, cart count (subscribe to `cart.service`).
     Acceptance criteria (per ticket)

* Auth flows persist token in secure storage (use `localStorage` or safer).
* Guarded routes redirect to login with `returnUrl`.
* Profile page shows user data and allows update; update triggers success toast.
  API endpoints to coordinate
* `POST /api/auth/login` -> `{ token, user }`
* `POST /api/auth/register`
* `GET /api/users/me`
* `PUT /api/users/me`
  Testing
* Unit tests for `auth.service`, `auth.interceptor`, `auth.guard`.
* E2E: login -> visit protected page -> see profile.

## Dev B — **Catalog, Product List, Product Detail, Search & Filters**

Ownership

* `src/app/features/product-list/`
* `src/app/features/product-detail/`
* `src/app/shared/components/product-card/`
* Search bar, filters (category, price range, sort), pagination/infinite scroll
  Tasks

1. Product list UI + product-card

   * `product-card` component used site-wide.
   * Product list page: grid, responsive breakpoints, accessibility.
2. Product detail page

   * Image gallery, description, specs, related products, reviews placeholder.
3. Search & filters

   * Query params in routes (e.g., `?q=&category=&page=2&sort=price_asc`).
   * Debounced search input, client-side & server-side filtering toggle.
4. Product service

   * `product.service.ts`: `getProducts(query)`, `getProductById(id)`, `getCategories()`.
     Acceptance criteria

* Product list responds to query params and deep links (refresh keeps filters).
* Product detail shows gallery and "add to cart" button calling `cart.service`.
  API endpoints to coordinate
* `GET /api/products?limit=&page=&q=&category=&minPrice=&maxPrice=&sort=`
* `GET /api/products/:id`
* `GET /api/categories`
  Testing
* Unit tests for `product.service` and product-card.
* Manual test: search -> open product -> back -> filters preserved.

## Dev C — **Cart, Checkout, Orders, Payments**

Ownership

* `src/app/features/cart/`
* `src/app/features/checkout/`
* `src/app/features/orders/`
* `src/app/core/services/cart.service.ts`, `order.service.ts`
* Payment integration wiring (Stripe/placeholder)
  Tasks

1. Cart UI & state

   * `cart.service` with RxJS observable for cart items, total, quantity updates, persistence to `localStorage`.
   * Cart page: update qty, remove item, apply coupon input (UI only), estimate shipping.
2. Checkout flow

   * Multi-step checkout: Shipping address -> Payment -> Review -> Confirmation.
   * Forms and validation. Use route children or a stepper component.
3. Payments integration (interface + test)

   * Provide a `payments.service` skeleton that calls backend `/api/checkout` (backend calls Stripe).
   * In dev, support a mock “card” input or Stripe Elements integration point (coordinate with backend on client secret).
4. Orders

   * After checkout: create order, show order confirmation page, add to `orders` module.
     Acceptance criteria

* Cart updates broadcast to header cart count.
* Checkout will block without required fields and show inline errors.
* After successful payment API response -> redirect to order confirmation and order appears in profile/orders.
  API endpoints to coordinate
* `GET /api/cart` (optional)
* `POST /api/cart` or `PATCH /api/cart` (sync)
* `POST /api/checkout` -> returns `{ paymentIntentClientSecret, order }` or redirect url
* `GET /api/orders/:id`
* `GET /api/users/me/orders`
  Security notes
* Never store raw card details in frontend; integrate Stripe Elements or redirect to provider. Coordinate exact flow with backend.
  Testing
* Unit tests for `cart.service`, checkout validators.
* E2E: add product -> checkout -> mock payment -> order confirmed.

## Dev D — **Shared UI, Admin, Styling, Tests & Release QA**

Ownership

* `src/app/shared/` components other than product-card (header/footer already wired), pipes, directives
* `src/app/features/admin/` module (product CRUD, order management)
* Global styling (Tailwind / styles.scss), design tokens, responsive breakpoints
* CI, linting, unit-test coverage, e2e tests
  Tasks

1. Shared components & polish

   * Implement `toast`, `modal`, `spinner`, `badge`, `form-field` components.
   * Create pipes (currency, truncate), directives (click-outside).
2. Admin module

   * Admin list pages: product CRUD UI + image upload (use `assets/mock/` for dev).
   * Order list with status update (processing, shipped, delivered).
3. Styling & accessibility

   * Centralize design tokens, Tailwind config or global SCSS variables.
   * Run axe checks and fix high-priority a11y issues (keyboard focus, alt text).
4. CI & QA

   * Setup `npm test` config, `npm run e2e` skeleton.
   * Maintain unit-test coverage baseline and review PRs for tests.
     Acceptance criteria

* Shared components are documented (small README or Storybook if available).
* Admin CRUD correctly calls backend endpoints and shows success/failure toasts.
* Styling consistent across pages; header/footer match mocks.
  Testing
* Unit tests for shared utils and pipes.
* E2E: critical flows (signup/login, product browse, add to cart, checkout) executed and passing.

# Common cross-team rules & process

**Branches / PRs**

* Branch naming: `feature/<initial>-<short-desc>` e.g. `feature/hamada-auth-login`
* Small PRs: aim for <250 LOC changes.
* PR title format: `[feat|fix|chore] - short description`
* Use draft PRs while working; assign one reviewer.

**Commit messages**

* Conventional style: `feat(auth): add login endpoint call`
* Keep commits focused & atomic.

**API contract coordination**

* Each dev creates a minimal `api-contract.md` for their endpoints with request/response examples and places it in `src/api-contracts/` (json examples). Share before implementing so backend and frontend agree on payload shapes.

**Issue -> PR -> Review checklist (copy into repo)**

* [ ] Does the PR implement the ticket acceptance criteria?
* [ ] Unit tests added/updated.
* [ ] End-to-end path run locally for critical flow.
* [ ] Lint and build pass.
* [ ] Accessibility quick check.
* [ ] `api-contract.md` updated if needed.

**Testing responsibilities**

* Each dev writes unit tests for services and core components they changed.
* Dev D owns CI setup and e2e tests maintenance.

**Mocking & local dev**

* Use `assets/mock/` json for products, categories, and users.
* Use `proxy.conf.json` to forward `/api` to backend: developers should point their environment variable `API_BASE` to `/api`.
* When backend unavailable, each dev should implement a minimal mock adapter in `product.service` or use an `HttpInterceptor` that returns mock data in dev mode.

# Example ticket (copy-paste)

Title: `feat: product list page + filters`
Description:

* Implement product list page at `/products`.
* Use `product.service.getProducts(queryParams)`.
* Show `product-card` grid (mobile 1col, tablet 2col, desktop 4col).
* Add filter sidebar (categories, price slider) and sorting dropdown.
  Acceptance criteria:
* Visiting `/products?q=shirt&category=men&page=2` reproduces correct list from API.
* Clicking a product navigates to `/products/:id`.
* Works with mock `assets/mock/products.json`.
  API contract (example)

```
GET /api/products?limit=20&page=1&q=shirt&category=men&minPrice=0&maxPrice=100&sort=price_asc
Response: {
  data: [{ id, name, price, images: [], shortDescription, rating, category }],
  meta: { page, limit, total }
}
```

# Small extras you can adopt immediately

* Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with PR checklist above.
* Add `API_CONTRACTS.md` folder where each dev drops example payloads.
* Add `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` with fields: Overview, Acceptance Criteria, API Contract, Screenshots.
* Each dev should create a single “demo” route each (e.g., `/dev/product-card-demo`) to review visuals without the rest of the app.

---

If you want, I can:

* turn these assignments into ready-to-copy GitHub issues (title + body + acceptance criteria + API contract) for all tasks, OR
* produce a kanban-style split (what to do first, second, final polish) without time estimates.

Which would you like me to generate next?
